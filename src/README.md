 ### Files
 This is the source directory which contains the following two python files:
+ `renderneuron.py` contains the functions for making and saving simple refinements, and spline refinements. The file also contains some plotting features
+ `parallelframe.py` contains the functions which uses [`Parallel Transport Frames`](https://legacy.cs.indiana.edu/ftp/techreports/TR425.pdf) to generate contours along a path, and then connects the contours to make a mesh. There is a function for writing the `.ugx` file which contains the mesh with surface triangulations.

### Render Neuron
The `renderneuron.py` file contains the following functions:

- `spline_neuron(Gin,delta_x)` this function takes in a graph object `Gin`, and a delta_x. This function makes a spline using the original `.swc` points on the trunk for interpolation. Then new points are generated by approximately dividing the splined trunk into delta_x segments.
- `get_trunks(G)` this function takes in a graph object `Gin` and find the branch points and then collects the corresponding trunks that are between branch points. The function returns a dictionary `trunks` with keys that are the trunk number and the values are a list of node indices that are in the trunk (including the endpoints which are branch points). It also returns a graph object for each trunk.
